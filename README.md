### Running inference with `inference.py`
The script is capable to run over a set of imaged inside a directory.
The weights will be loaded by the script, they only need to be included inside the directory `Models/`.
The command below will run as you requested for verifying with other images.
```
python inference.py --input_dir <dir>
```
